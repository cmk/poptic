{-
The laws for a 'Traversal' follow from the laws for 'Traversable' as stated in "The Essence of the Iterator Pattern".

Identity:

traverseOf t (Identity . f) â‰¡  Identity (fmap f)

Composition:

Compose . fmap (traverseOf t f) . traverseOf t g == traverseOf t (Compose . fmap f . g)

One consequence of this requirement is that a 'Traversal' needs to leave the same number of elements as a
candidate for subsequent 'Traversal' that it started with.
